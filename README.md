## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### General Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or download the repository**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to your desired directory
   cd "path/to/flask projects"
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies for each application**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to each app directory and install requirements
   cd flask_blog_app
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   cd ../flask_book_api
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Repeat for other applications
   ```

### Individual Application Setup

Each application can be run independently. Navigate to the specific application directory and follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Initialize the database (if required)**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   # Most apps will create the database automatically on first run
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - Open your web browser
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in the app)

## üìã Common Dependencies

Most applications use these common packages:
- `Flask` - Web framework
- `Flask-SQLAlchemy` - Database ORM
- `Flask-Login` - User session management
- `Werkzeug` - WSGI utilities
- `Jinja2` - Template engine

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Some applications may require environment variables for configuration:
- `SECRET_KEY` - Flask secret key for session management
- `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection string
- `API_KEYS` - External service API keys (weather, etc.)

### Database Setup
Most applications use SQLite databases stored in the `instance/` directory. The databases are created automatically when the application runs for the first time.

## üöÄ Running Multiple Applications

Since each application runs on different ports or can be configured to do so, you can run multiple applications simultaneously:

1. **Flask Blog App**: `http://localhost:5000`
2. **Flask Book API**: `http://localhost:5001`
3. **Flask Chat App**: `http://localhost:5002`
4. **Flask E-commerce**: `http://localhost:5003`
5. **Flask Expense Tracker**: `http://localhost:5004`
6. **Flask Todo App**: `http://localhost:5005`
7. **Flask Weather App**: `http://localhost:5006`
8. **Novel Viewer**: `http://localhost:5007`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**
   - Change the port in `app.py` or stop other running applications
   - Use `flask run --port=5001` to specify a different port

2. **Database errors**
   - Delete the database file in the `instance/` directory
   - Restart the application to recreate the database

3. **Import errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check that you're in the correct virtual environment

4. **Template errors**
   - Verify all template files are present in the `templates/` directory
   - Check for syntax errors in HTML templates
